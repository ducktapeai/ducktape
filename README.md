# DuckTape ðŸ¦†

Your AI-powered command-line productivity assistant for macOS. DuckTape seamlessly integrates with Apple's native apps while providing natural language interaction.

We coined the term Productivity as AI, Smooth as a Duck "Unlock Productivity with AIâ€”For Everyone, On Every Device"

## Examples

Natural language commands:
```bash
>> schedule a team meeting tomorrow at 2pm
ðŸ¦† Interpreting as: ducktape calendar "Team Meeting" 2024-02-06 14:00 "Work"

>> remind me to buy groceries next Monday
ðŸ¦† Interpreting as: ducktape todo "Buy groceries" --reminder-time "2024-02-12 09:00"
