# DuckTape ðŸ¦† - Your Personal TimeAI

DuckTape is an AI-powered command-line interface that simplifies managing your Apple Calendar, Reminders, and Notes. DuckTape now supports a **hybrid CLI**: you can use direct commands, natural language in interactive mode, or run natural language directly from the terminal using the `ai` subcommand.

> **Note**: DuckTape currently only works on macOS and requires Apple Calendar, Reminders, and Notes to be properly configured on your system. [Learn how to set up Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/set-up-icloud-calendar-icl1022/mac).
> DuckTape will use your native Apple capabilities, for example Apple Contacts, Apple Reminders and so forth. Please ensure these Applications are properly setup and configured.

```toml
[language_model]
provider = "Grok"  # Options: "OpenAI", "Grok", "DeepSeek", or leave empty for Terminal Mode

[calendar]
default_calendar = "Work"
default_reminder_minutes = 15
default_duration_minutes = 60

[reminder]
default_list = "Reminders"
default_reminder = true

[notes]
default_folder = "Notes"
```

### Viewing and Editing Configuration
- To view the current configuration:
  ```bash
  ducktape config show all
  ```
- To change settings via command line:
  ```bash
  ducktape config set language_model.provider "grok"
  ```

## Advanced Features

### Zoom Integration
DuckTape can create Zoom meetings directly from both Terminal Mode and Natural Language Mode.

Set up Zoom integration with:
```bash
export ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID='your-zoom-account-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID='your-zoom-client-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET='your-zoom-client-secret'
```

For more details on Zoom integration, see [ducktapeai.com/docs/zoom.html](https://ducktapeai.com/docs/zoom.html).

### Contact Integration

DuckTape integrates with Apple Contacts to automatically look up email addresses:

```bash
ducktape calendar create "Project Discussion" 2025-04-28 14:00 15:00 "Work" --contacts "Joe Duck, Jane Doe"
```

Or in Natural Language Mode:
```
ðŸ¦† schedule a meeting with Joe Duck and Jane Doe tomorrow at 2pm
```

The latest version (0.16.11) provides enhanced contact extraction with support for the "and invite" pattern in natural language commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing API Keys**: Ensure you have set the required environment variables for your chosen language model provider.
- **Invalid Calendar Name**: Use `ducktape calendar list` to see available calendars.
- **Contact Not Found**: Verify that the contact exists in your Apple Contacts app.
- **Zoom Integration Issues**: Check that your Zoom API credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- **Time Parsing Problems**: If times aren't recognized correctly, try to be more explicit with AM/PM designations.

DuckTape provides detailed logging information that can help diagnose issues:

```
