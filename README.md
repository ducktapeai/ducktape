# DuckTape ðŸ¦†

Time possible the most important commodity. At DuckTape we recognise that.
So we figured why dont we combine how we interact with time and mix it with a touch of AI.
Effectively you "TimeAI"
Our goal is ambitious, to interact naturally (-clicking in Calendars) and get to a place where suggestions happen.
Your time, your way, with what AI thinks can help your day run smoothly. Work towards a common goal you might have.

We have started this journey off as unified CLI (soon to be App) for Apple Calendar, Reminders, and Notes with natural language support.

So why wait, give it some TimeAI ðŸ¦†

## Architecture

DuckTape follows a modular architecture pattern:
- Command pattern for processing different command types
- Natural language processing adapters for different LLM providers
- Clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and state management

## State Files

DuckTape maintains state in the following files:
- `~/.ducktape/todos.json` - Todo items
- `~/.ducktape/events.json` - Calendar events
- `~/.ducktape/config.json` - Application configuration

## Requirements

- macOS with Calendar.app configured
- Rust toolchain
