# DuckTape ü¶Ü

## Description

DuckTape is an AI-powered command-line interface that makes it easy to manage your Apple Calendar, Reminders, and Notes. Just type what you want to do in natural language, and DuckTape's AI will understand and execute the appropriate command.

> **Note**: DuckTape currently only works on macOS and requires Apple Calendar to be properly configured on your system. [Learn how to set up Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/set-up-icloud-calendar-icl1022/mac)

## Installation

From crates.io:
```bash
cargo install ducktape
```

From source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DuckTapeAI/ducktape.git
cd ducktape
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start

1. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Required if using OpenAI
GROK_API_KEY=your_key_here    # Required if using Grok
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here # Required if using DeepSeek
```

2. Run DuckTape:
```bash
ducktape
```

For API server mode:
```bash
ducktape --api-server
```

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Set up required API keys (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below)
4. Build and run:
```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Running Modes
DuckTape can be run in three different modes:

1. Terminal-only mode (default):
```bash
ducktape
```
Starts DuckTape in a terminal interface without the API server. Best for command-line usage.

2. API server-only mode:
```bash
ducktape --api-server
```
Starts only the API server on port 3000. Useful for integrating with the DuckTape Desktop app or other clients.

3. Full mode:
```bash
ducktape --full
```
Starts both the terminal interface and API server. Use this if you want to use both interfaces simultaneously.

## Environment Variables
DuckTape uses several environment variables to store sensitive configuration information:

### Required for AI Language Models:
Choose at least one of the following AI providers:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'

# For Grok (XAI)
export XAI_API_KEY='your-xai-api-key-here'

# For DeepSeek
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your-deepseek-api-key-here'
```

### Required for Zoom Integration:
```bash
# Zoom credentials
export ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID='your-zoom-account-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID='your-zoom-client-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET='your-zoom-client-secret'
```

You can add these to your shell profile file (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, or `.bash_profile`) for persistence across terminal sessions.

## Natural Language Examples

Just type what you want to do:
- "schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm"
- "remind me to buy groceries next Monday morning"
- "take notes about the project meeting"
- "add a todo about calling the bank"

## Zoom Integration
DuckTape provides seamless integration with Zoom for creating meeting links directly in your calendar events. There are two ways to set up Zoom integration:

### Option 1: Using the Interactive Setup
```bash
# Run the interactive setup
ducktape zoom-setup
```

This command will guide you through the process of entering your Zoom credentials and save them securely.

### Option 2: Using Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables before running DuckTape:
```bash
export ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID='your-zoom-account-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID='your-zoom-client-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET='your-zoom-client-secret'
```

### Creating a Server-to-Server OAuth App in Zoom
To get the required credentials:

1. Sign in to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
2. Click "Develop" in the top-right corner
3. Select "Build App"
4. Choose "Server-to-Server OAuth" app type
5. Enter app name and other required information
6. Under "Scopes", add the following permissions:
   - `meeting:write:admin` or `meeting:write`
   - `user:read:admin` or `user:read`
7. Create the app and collect the Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret
8. Your app might need to be activated or submitted for approval depending on your Zoom account type

### Using Zoom in Calendar Events
Once configured, you can add Zoom meetings to calendar events using:

```bash
# Command-line approach
ducktape calendar create "Meeting Title" 2023-06-15 14:00 15:00 --zoom

# Or using natural language
"schedule a zoom meeting with the team tomorrow at 3pm for one hour"
```

## Calendar Import
DuckTape supports importing calendar events from CSV and ICS files. 

### CSV Format Requirements
The CSV file should have the following columns:
- title (required): Event title
- date (required): YYYY-MM-DD format
- start_time (required): HH:MM format (24-hour)
- end_time (required): HH:MM format (24-hour)
- calendar (optional): Calendar name to add event to
- description (optional): Event description
- location (optional): Event location
- attendees (optional): Comma-separated email addresses

Example CSV:
```csv
title,date,start_time,end_time,calendar,description,location,attendees
Team Meeting,2024-02-15,14:00,15:00,Work,Weekly sync,Conference Room A,john@example.com;jane@example.com
```

### ICS Format
DuckTape supports standard iCalendar (.ics) files following the RFC 5545 specification. When importing ICS files, DuckTape will:
- Preserve all event properties including attendees, location, and description
- Handle recurring events with their full recurrence rules
- Import reminders and alerts
- Maintain event categories and classifications

## Features

- Natural language command processing with multiple AI model support:
  - OpenAI
  - Grok (X.AI)
  - DeepSeek
- Smart date/time understanding ("tomorrow", "next Monday")
- Context-aware calendar selection
- Automatic email attendee addition
- Recurring events support (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Contact lookup for event attendees
- Zoom meeting integration with automatic meeting creation
- State persistence
- Calendar integration with Apple Calendar.app
- Modular, well-organized code architecture

## Security Features
- Command injection prevention through proper input sanitization and escaping
- Secure API key handling via environment variables rather than hardcoded values
- Validation of all user inputs before processing
- Size and data limits on JSON parsing to prevent DoS attacks
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- Memory-safe mutex handling for concurrent operations
- Path traversal prevention in file operations
- Automatic security checks with `security-check.sh` script

## Running Security Checks
DuckTape includes a comprehensive security check script:

```bash
# Run the security checks
chmod +x security-check.sh
./security-check.sh
```

The script checks for:
- Dependency vulnerabilities using cargo-audit
- License compliance and additional dependency checks with cargo-deny
- Code quality issues with Clippy security lints
- Common vulnerable patterns like unwrap(), expect(), and unsafe blocks
- Potential command injection vulnerabilities
- Secure handling of sensitive data

## Architecture

DuckTape follows a modular architecture pattern:
- Command pattern for processing different command types
- Natural language processing adapters for different LLM providers
- Clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and state management

## State Files

DuckTape maintains state in the following files:
- `~/.ducktape/todos.json` - Todo items
- `~/.ducktape/events.json` - Calendar events
- `~/.ducktape/config.json` - Application configuration

## Requirements

- macOS with Calendar.app configured
- Rust toolchain
- API key for at least one supported language model provider (OpenAI, Grok, or DeepSeek)
- (Optional) Zoom API credentials for meeting integration

## Security Best Practices
- Make sure you always keep your API keys confidential and use environment variables
- Regularly run `cargo update` and `cargo audit` to keep dependencies up to date and secure
- Never edit the generated JSON state files manually
- Consider using application-specific passwords for calendar access if using iCloud
- Store Zoom API credentials securely in your system keychain
